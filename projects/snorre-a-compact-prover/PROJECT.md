## Critical Issues for Teams Call

1. **Modular split engineering** — How to split the SVP into modules ≤ 1.4×2.56×2.2m while maintaining structural integrity and calibration accuracy after re-assembly
2. **Honeywell quote timeline** — Can Honeywell deliver a quote by 4 March, or do we need to request an extension from Guidant?
3. **Sour service materials** — BD20X + NACE MR0175 compliance for all wetted parts
4. **Re-assembly and warranty** — Warranty starts after vendor re-assembly and release on Snorre A; logistics and offshore labor scope
5. **Seraphin can certification** — Justervesenet certification lead time
6. **Specification worksheet** — Fill in process conditions and Norsok requirements from the RFQ into Honeywell's QCF524 worksheet
7. **Offshore punch-checklists** — Complete the Norsok-specific requirements checklists
