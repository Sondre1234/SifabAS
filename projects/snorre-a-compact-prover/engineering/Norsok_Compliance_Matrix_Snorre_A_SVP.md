## Action Items Before Sending Quote to Guidant

1. **Honeywell** to confirm SVP model selection (likely SVP085) and modular split concept
2. **Honeywell** to confirm re-assembly procedure maintains ≤0.020% repeatability
3. **Guidant** to clarify 60Hz motor requirement (TQ-001)
4. **Honeywell** to confirm thermowell sourcing per TR2000 BD20X (TQ-008)
5. **Honeywell** to confirm Norsok M-630 MDS for flow tube material
