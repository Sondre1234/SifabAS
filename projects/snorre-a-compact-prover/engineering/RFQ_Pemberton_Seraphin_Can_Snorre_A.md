## 1. Background

Sifab AS is supplying a Honeywell Small Volume Prover (SVP085) for Equinor's Snorre A platform in the Norwegian North Sea. We require a Seraphin calibration can for water draw testing at the factory (FAT) and on the platform (SAT).

Sifab has previously purchased two Seraphin cans from Pemberton for our NOA/Valhall prover projects:
- **151.4 Liter** — Series M, S/N 24-67715, Cert #24228 (Feb 2024)
- **75.7 Liter** — Series M, S/N 24-67716, Cert #24231 (Feb 2024)

We are very satisfied with the quality and wish to order another can for the Snorre A project.
