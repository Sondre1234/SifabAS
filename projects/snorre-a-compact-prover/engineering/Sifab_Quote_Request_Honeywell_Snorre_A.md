## 5. SVP Model Selection — Question for Honeywell

Based on the flow rate requirement of 67–750 m³/h for ultrasonic meter proving:

| Model | Max flow (US meters) | Comment |
|-------|---------------------|---------|
| SVP025 | 248 m³/h | **Too small** — does not cover 750 m³/h |
| SVP035 | 310 m³/h | **Too small** — does not cover 750 m³/h |
| SVP050 | 495 m³/h | **Too small** — does not cover 750 m³/h |
| SVP085 | 929 m³/h | **Covers 750 m³/h** — recommended? |
| SVP120 | 1487 m³/h | Covers with margin, but larger/heavier |

**Please confirm the recommended SVP model considering:**
- Max 750 m³/h for ultrasonic meter
- Modular split constraints (max 1.4 × 2.56 × 2.2m per module)
- 1-second minimum stroke time requirement

## 6. Clarifications / Technical Queries (TQs)

| TQ# | Question | For |
|-----|----------|-----|
| TQ-001 | Motor power is specified as 230VAC, 3-phase, **60Hz**. Norwegian standard is 50Hz. Please confirm if this is correct or if it should be 50Hz. | Guidant/Equinor |
| TQ-002 | Which SVP model is recommended for 750 m³/h USM proving with modular split constraints? | Honeywell |
| TQ-003 | Can the SVP be split and re-assembled while maintaining ≤0.020% repeatability? What is the re-calibration procedure after re-assembly? | Honeywell |
| TQ-004 | What is the estimated lead time for the recommended SVP model? Can we meet or approach the 4 March bid deadline? | Honeywell |
| TQ-005 | Justervesenet certification for Seraphin can — estimated lead time? | Honeywell |
| TQ-006 | What is the estimated offshore man-hours for re-assembly and SAT on Snorre A? | Honeywell |
| TQ-007 | Temperature elements and transmitters are free-issued by Guidant. Confirm Honeywell will install the TE but not supply pressure transmitters. | Honeywell |
| TQ-008 | Thermowell material — TR2000 BD20X. Can Honeywell source thermowells per this MDS, or should Sifab/Guidant free-issue? | Honeywell |
