## 1. Background

Sifab AS is supplying a Honeywell Small Volume Prover (SVP085) for Equinor's Snorre A platform in the Norwegian North Sea. We require a water draw kit for calibration testing at the factory (FAT) and on the platform (SAT).

Sifab previously purchased water draw kit components from Flowtec for our NOA/Valhall prover projects (SP-00525 / SP-00577). We are satisfied with the supply and wish to order again for Snorre A.

## 2. Items Required

### 2.1 Solenoid Valves

| # | Item | Specification |
|---|------|---------------|
| 1 | Solenoid valve — water draw circuit | Per previous supply: Lucifer model 201LG4SVG7 with coil 492190C2, or equivalent |

| Parameter | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| Type | Direct pilot operated, 2-port, spring return |
| Body material | SS 316 |
| Ports | 1/2" BSP female |
| Trim | NBR |
| Operating medium | Water / neutral liquids |
| Operating pressure | 0–2 bar (DC) |
| Operating temperature | -10°C to +140°C |
| Supply voltage | 24 VDC |
| IP rating | IP66 |
| ATEX classification | Ex eb mb IIC T3/T4 |
| Cable entry | M20 × 1.5 |
| Quantity | 2 (confirm with Honeywell GA — may need 1 or 2 per water draw circuit) |

**Lesson learned from previous project:** The solenoid valve orifice size had to be changed during FAT (smaller orifice needed). Please advise on the recommended orifice size for an SVP085 prover. We want to get this right from the start.

### 2.2 Water Draw Kit Tubing and Fittings

| # | Item | Specification |
|---|------|---------------|
| 2 | Tubing | 1" 6Mo (UNS N08367) — **use 1" from start** (lesson learned: NOA/Valhall was specified as 1/2" and had to be upgraded to 1" via variation order at significant cost) |
| 3 | Fittings | 1" 6Mo Hoke Gyrolok compression fittings |
| 4 | Elbows | 1" 6Mo — required due to larger bending radius of 1" tubing |
| 5 | Manual instrument valves | SS 316 minimum, 1/2" or as required by circuit design |

### 2.3 Complete Kit Assembly

Sifab can either:
- **(A)** Purchase components and assemble the water draw kit in-house, or
- **(B)** Have Flowtec supply a complete assembled and tested water draw kit

**Please quote both options.**
