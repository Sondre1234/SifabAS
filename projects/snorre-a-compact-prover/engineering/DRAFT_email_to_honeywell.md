Hi Sidney,

Following our discussions and today's Teams call, please find attached our complete quote request package for the Snorre A Small Volume Prover.

We have reviewed the RFQ from Guidant (GM-8501-1447) and filled in the Honeywell Specification Worksheet (QCF524) and the Snorre offshore punchlist with all available data from the RFQ and process datasheet.

**Attachments:**
1. Sifab Quote Request — summary of scope, process data, technical requirements, and quotation format requested
2. QCF524 Specification Worksheet — filled with Snorre A data
3. Snorre A Punchlist — updated with RFQ-specific requirements
4. Norsok & Equinor TR Compliance Matrix — showing compliance status for all 26 requirements
5. Original RFQ (GM-8501-1447, Rev. A)
6. Process Datasheet (S1-AA-PDE-0219, Rev. 02S)
7. General Terms & Conditions (PP-PS-13)

**Key items requiring Honeywell input:**
- SVP model recommendation (we believe SVP085 based on 750 m³/h USM requirement — please confirm)
- Modular split concept for max W1.4 × L2.56 × H2.2m modules
- Confirmation that ≤0.020% repeatability is maintained after re-assembly
- Lead time estimate
- Offshore re-assembly man-hours estimate

**Open TQ to Guidant (for reference):**
- TQ-001: Motor power specified as 60Hz — unusual for Norway, we will clarify with Guidant

Please let us know if you need any additional information to prepare the quotation.
